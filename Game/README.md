HTML/Js Game Project -Coin

This coin game is to deminstate my HTML/CSS/JS skill. This game is a basic coin flipping game where you click on the button "oink" to get a value Tails or Head.

Ways that I want to improve this game:
to be able to stop the animation to get a value rather than have a simple printed text.
